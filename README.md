# C++ Course Example: Cosine Similarity

This is a code example for the *Intro to Programming with C++* course at the University of Guilan, Fall 2016.

The purpose of this example is to familiarize students with:
- Functions,
- Pointers and references,
- Arrays,
- Strings,
- Streams, and
- Files.

In this example, we'll:
- Read two lines of text from two files, and
- Tokenize them;
- Read a list of [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) from another file, and
- Filter them out;
- Compute the [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) of the two lines of text (using frequencies), and
- Write the result into a file.
